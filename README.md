# ServerManager
A low-level Minecraft Server managing tool (if you have a better name...)  
Currently only includes a CLI mainly for creating and restoring backups of servers.  
## Roadmap
In the future, ServerManager needs to have:  
 - Linux and macOS binaries  
 - A Windows installer  
 - GUI  
 - Ability to install Minecraft servers  
 - Ability to modify server configuration  
 - Automatic server deployment to Internet using forwarding through domain  
 - Lots and lots of features and bugfixes  
  
Pull requests are more than welcome!
