Needed Bugfixes
--------------
1. When compiled to EXE, the exit() function seems to have broken.

C:\Users\Maxwell>servermanager
ServerManager v0.1-Pre_Release for Windows
Type "help" for a list of commands
> exit
Quitting.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "ServerManager.py", line 45, in <module>
NameError: name 'exit' is not defined
[PYI-15212:ERROR] Failed to execute script 'ServerManager' due to unhandled exception!

2. Need to store the servermgr.ini file in a default location so all instances can access it from any working directory.
3. Need to check if script has permissions to create servermgr.ini

C:\Windows>servermanager
Welcome to ServerManager
Where should ServerManager look for servers (full path)?: C:\MinecraftServers
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "ServerManager.py", line 11, in <module>
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'servermgr.ini'
[PYI-9720:ERROR] Failed to execute script 'ServerManager' due to unhandled exception!

4. Breaks down completely if path doesn't exist

C:\>servermanager
Welcome to ServerManager
Where should ServerManager look for servers (full path)?: thisisnotapath
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "ServerManager.py", line 11, in <module>
