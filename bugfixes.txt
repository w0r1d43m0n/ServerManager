Needed Bugfixes
--------------
1. When compiled to EXE, the exit() function seems to have broken.

C:\Users\Maxwell>servermanager
ServerManager v0.1-Pre_Release for Windows
Type "help" for a list of commands
> exit
Quitting.
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "ServerManager.py", line 45, in <module>
NameError: name 'exit' is not defined
[PYI-15212:ERROR] Failed to execute script 'ServerManager' due to unhandled exception!
Fixed in version v0.2-Pre_Release

2. Need to store the servermgr.ini file in a default location so all instances can access it from any working directory.
(supposedly) Fixed in version v0.2-Pre_Release

3. Need to check if script has permissions to create servermgr.ini

C:\Windows>servermanager
Welcome to ServerManager
Where should ServerManager look for servers (full path)?: C:\MinecraftServers
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "ServerManager.py", line 11, in <module>
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'servermgr.ini'
[PYI-9720:ERROR] Failed to execute script 'ServerManager' due to unhandled exception!
Fixed in version v0.2-Pre_Release

4. Breaks down completely if path doesn't exist ONLY WHEN COMPILED TO EXE

C:\>servermanager
Welcome to ServerManager
Where should ServerManager look for servers (full path)?: thisisnotapath
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "ServerManager.py", line 11, in <module>
OSError: [Errno 22] Invalid argument: 'servermgr.ini'
[PYI-7764:ERROR] Failed to execute script 'ServerManager' due to unhandled exception!
Fixed in version v0.2-Pre_Release...? Not sure what I did but it's gone now

5. [Minor] Won't say command exists if typed without a space
If typed without a space, show detailed help for that program

6. [Minor] When running `info servers` the server creation date can be inaccurate if a backup was ever restored.
The program should use the oldest file in the server folder for more accuracy
